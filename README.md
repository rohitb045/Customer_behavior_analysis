## About  
In this project, we analyze customer shopping behavior, segment customers using RFM and clustering, evaluate purchase journeys and cross‑sell opportunities, identify churn risk, and build an interactive sales performance dashboard. The outcome supports data‑driven decision‑making for business growth and retention.

## Problem Statement  
- How can we **segment customers** to better target marketing and improve retention?  
- What are the **purchase journeys** and where are cross‑sell opportunities?  
- Which customers show **churn risk** and how can retention be improved?  
- How can we build a **dashboard** to visualize regional sales trends and inventory performance for actionable insights?

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming & Querying:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit‑learn), SQL  
- **Data Visualization & Dashboarding:** Power BI  
- **Data Sources / Formats:** CSV / SQL dumps  
- **Analytics Techniques:** RFM segmentation, clustering (unsupervised learning), regression/classification (where applicable)

## Project Flow  
1. Data Ingestion & Cleaning  
2. Feature Engineering: RFM metrics, clustering labels, churn indicators  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): trend identification, regional performance, inventory insights  
4. Modeling & Segmentation: clustering customer segments, churn risk prediction  
5. Dashboard Development: build interactive reports in Power BI displaying key metrics and insights  
6. Business Insight Delivery: actionable recommendations based on analytics and visualization  

## Key Highlights & Outcomes  
- Segmented customers into distinct groups using RFM + clustering and profiled their behavior.  
- Analyzed purchase journeys and highlighted cross‑sell opportunities to boost revenue.  
- Identified customers at high risk of churn and created a retention dashboard to prioritize outreach.  
- Built and deployed an interactive dashboard tracking sales trends, regional performance, and inventory optimization.  
- Delivered improved reporting efficiency, enabling stakeholders to make faster, data‑driven decisions.
